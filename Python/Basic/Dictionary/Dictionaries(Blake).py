# Dictionaries

# This program demonstrates how lists are created using Python

# First we name the dictionary 
dictionary = {"Blake": 1234, "Logan": 5678, "David": 8765, "Bob": 4321}
# As you can see, in the dictionary you have 2 values, str (string) and int (integer)
# With a dictionary you are able to set 2 different values for the function itself. Thats why Blake is assigned the number 1234

# Now all you need to do is call it with a print()
print(dictionary)

# And with the same for lists you are able to call each name and number singularly
print(dictionary["Blake"])
# In this case the console will output the number of the name that you had called in the dictionary and not the name
# This is because you already know who you're selecting to call into the print()
