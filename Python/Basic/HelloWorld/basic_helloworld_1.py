print('Hello World!') # print is self explanatory, it will print to the terminal/output. In this sense it has printed out "Hello World!"

answer = input("What is your name?\n") 
# this question is printed to the user and is a basic input for the user to reply to the question asked. 
# In this case it is asking the name of the user

print("Hello" + " " + answer)
# this is to reply to the users input with a basic greeting back to the user, it will also space the word "Hello" and the users name.
